This repo contains two Jupyter Notebooks.

The first one - data4denoiser - takes a video, splits it into images and add a watermark. 

The second - Denoiser1 - defines a denoiser out of CNNs. The images generated by data4denoiser are used to train the model.

Other files:
- a short mp4 video
- two watermark pngs
- an example of input image --> data4denoiser --> watermarked image

the last one should also be an example of watermarked image --> Denoiser1 --> input image.
